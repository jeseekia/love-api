# API for Love

API for Love is a mobile app that allows couples to create and share their own "API endpoints" for expressing love, with features like sending virtual hugs, kisses, or romantic messages.

The API for Love is an app inspired by a conversation and recommendation from ChatGPT.

This goal for this project is to maintain a production-grade personal project to further my skills and development as a Senior Software Engineer, balancing learning and feature deployment. Unlike other pet projects, I do not want this to be half-implemented in any regards.
